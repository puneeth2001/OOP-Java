	<h2>What is open source software?</h2>

<font size="4"><p>Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.</p></font>
<h2>
What's the difference between open source software and other types of software?</h2>
<font size="4"><p>Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it—and maintains exclusive control over it—can modify. People call this kind of software "proprietary" or "closed source" software.

Only the original authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software. And in order to use proprietary software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license displayed the first time they run this software) that they will not do anything with the software that the software's authors have not expressly permitted. Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop are examples of proprietary software.

Open source software is different. Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it. LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program are examples of open source software.

As they do with proprietary software, users must accept the terms of a license when they use open source software—but the legal terms of open source licenses differ dramatically from those of proprietary licenses.

Open source licenses affect the way people can use, study, modify, and distribute software. In general, open source licenses grant computer users permission to use open source software for any purpose they wish. Some open source licenses—what some people call "copyleft" licenses—stipulate that anyone who releases a modified open source program must also release the source code for that program alongside it. Moreover, some open source licenses stipulate that anyone who alters and shares a program with others must also share that program's source code without charging a licensing fee for it.

By design, open source software licenses promote collaboration and sharing because they permit other people to make modifications to source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects. They encourage computer programmers to access, view, and modify open source software whenever they like, as long as they let others do the same when they share their work.</p></font>
<h2>List of open source softwares</h2>
<font size="4"><p>Linux<br />Firefox<br />Wordpress<br />Apache HTTP server></p></font>
<h2>A piece of code or Software can be of two types :</h2>

<p>Closed Source : When the owner company of software or developer decides to not show his work backgrounds to whole world, or does not wants to be edited without his permission, due to privacy, or earning from it, then that code or Software is called closed source software, for example Windows,. And many softwares by Windows, they are neither free nor you can customise according to your need…
Open Source : When the owners keeps the code or Software open for all, letting other users download the code, edit the code according their need, and use it without permission from the owner, that code or Software is known as open source code. For example very famous Linux or Android, they are free to use and doesn't require any licence to use, in terms of modifications various versions of Linux (mint, Kali, Ubuntu etc) and Android (AOSP, LOS, MIUI, etc) are available in market and they are free to use.</p>

  <h2>Apache</h2>
  <font size="4"><p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a non-profit corporation that oversees development of Apache software. The organization was founded in 1999 is based in Forest Hill, Maryland.


Membership is based on contribution to the foundation's open source projects; individual candidates must be nominated and approved by a majority of members. Corporations are not eligible for membership.

The ASF currently oversees more than 100 top-level projects (TLPs), many of which also have subprojects. Top-level projects include:

Apache HTTP server, a freely available Web server that runs on most operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and Netware.

Cassandra, an open source distributed database system designed for storing and managing large amounts of data across commodity servers.

CloudStack, a cloud management platform for delivering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in cloud computing environments.

Hive, an open-source data warehouse system for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in Hadoop files.

Hadoop, a free, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment.

Although there is some speculation that the name Apache was created as a play on words (a patchy Web server), the foundation says that the pun is coincidental. According to the ASF, the name was chosen in tribute to "the various Native American nations collectively referred to as Apache, well-known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance."

The ASF was formerly known as the Apache Group.
The Apache License has gone through three different versions since its creation. Version 1.1 was approved by ASF in 2000, with the primary change from 1.0 being the addition of the advertising clause. The advertising clause specified that derived products were no longer required to include attribution in advertising materials, just in their documentation.

The current version, 2.0, was approved in 2004, with several new goals in mind. With this version, the ASF wanted to reduce the number of frequently asked questions surrounding the license, allow it to be reusable without modification by any project, allow it to be included by reference instead of having to be listed in every file, clarify the submission of contributions, require a patent license on contributions that infringe on the contributor’s own patents, and move comments regarding Apache and other inherited attribution notices to an outside “NOTICE” file, Shaposhnik said.

These changes resulted in the license that is used today, one that is compatible with other open source licenses while still remaining true to the initial goals of the ASF. It also resulted in a license that is supportive of collaborative development across nonprofit and commercial organizations.

The current version has been in place for 14 years, and while there may be business and technology reasons to change it in the future, Shaposhnik compares it to the United States Constitution in that a lot of interests depend on how clearly it can be interpreted and understood.

“With the current version of Apache License we have 14 years worth of foundation to be sure that we understand it pretty well,” Shaposhnik explained. “Any tweak to the license will have to withstand a comparable amount of test of time.”</p></font>
